This repository provides a Docker image for a comprehensive Terraform toolkit. It bundles essential Terraform-related tools such as Terraform, Terragrunt, Checkov, TFDoc, TFLint, and Trivy to streamline infrastructure management, security checks, and linting.

## 🧰 Tools Included
The Docker image includes the following tools:

- 🌍 [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/): Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool to manage cloud and on-prem resources.
- 🚜 [Terragrunt](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/): A thin wrapper for Terraform that provides extra tools for keeping your configurations DRY.
- 🔍 [Checkov](https://www.checkov.io/): Static code analysis tool for infrastructure-as-code to detect cloud misconfigurations.
- 📄 [terraform-docs](https://terraform-docs.io/): Generate documentation for your Terraform modules in various output formats.
- 🔧 [TFLint](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint): A linter for Terraform code to detect potential errors and enforce best practices.
- 🛡️ [Trivy](https://trivy.dev/): Comprehensive security scanner for containers and Terraform configurations (replaces deprecated TFSec).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites
Make sure you have Docker installed on your system before using this image.

#### Install Docker
📥 Pulling the Docker Image

The image repository: [terraform-toolkit](https://hub.docker.com/r/ops4life/terraform-toolkit) 📦

To pull the pre-built Docker image from Docker Hub:

```bash
docker pull ops4life/terraform-toolkit:latest
```

#### 🏃 Usage
To run the container:

```bash
docker run -it ops4life/terraform-toolkit:latest
```

You can then use the following tools from within the container:

- terraform
- terragrunt
- checkov
- terraform-docs
- tflint
- trivy
- eksctl
- pre-commit

### 💡 Example
Run Terraform commands inside the container:

```bash
docker run -v $(pwd):/workspace -w /workspace ops4life/terraform-toolkit:latest terraform init
```

This command mounts your current working directory (pwd) into the container’s /workspace directory and runs terraform init.

### ⚙️ Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery
This repository includes several GitHub Actions workflows to automate testing, dependency updates, and release processes.

- 🔨 Build and Test: The build-tf-toolkit-image.yaml workflow builds and tests the Docker image automatically.
- 🧪 Image Testing: The test-image.yaml workflow runs comprehensive tests on all tools in the image.
- 🔄 Dependency Checks: The check-tool-updates.yaml and deps-review.yaml workflows handle automatic updates and reviews of dependencies.
- 📦 Release Automation: The release.yaml workflow automates creating new releases with semantic versioning.
- 🔍 Pre-commit Checks: The pre-commit-auto-update.yaml ensures that pre-commit hooks and lints are consistently maintained.

For detailed information about CI/CD workflows, see [.github/workflows/README.md](.github/workflows/README.md).

### 🧪 Testing

This repository includes a comprehensive test suite to validate all tools in the Docker image.

#### Quick Start

```bash
# Navigate to test directory
cd test

# Test all tool versions
make test-versions

# Run full test suite
make test

# Run Terraform workflow
make init validate plan

# Run security scans
make security
```

#### Test Coverage

- ✅ **Tool Versions** - Verify all 9 tools are installed and accessible
- ✅ **Terraform Workflow** - Test init, validate, fmt, plan, apply, destroy
- ✅ **Code Quality** - TFLint checks and formatting validation
- ✅ **Security Scanning** - Checkov and Trivy scans (Trivy replaces deprecated TFSec)
- ✅ **Documentation** - terraform-docs generation
- ✅ **Terragrunt** - Terragrunt workflow testing

- [TEST_GUIDE.md](TEST_GUIDE.md) - Comprehensive testing guide
- [test/README.md](test/README.md) - Test suite documentation
